PROJECT : MAKING A STUDENT DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

OBJECTIVE : The main objective of this project is to add mobility and automation to the process of managing Student information in an institute. In a real-world environment, such as a college campus, information is disseminated to students in the form of notices, handwritten manuals, and vocal messages. Today, it is critical to employ not only the traditional forms of statement, but also newer ones, such as cell phone technology, to facilitate faster and easier communication among students. The college staff uses android devices to upload results and college information to a secure android application. Before any record changes, all data is thoroughly examined and validated on the server. The college Administrator manages the MYSql Database, where all data is safely kept. The method reduces paperwork and the amount of time it takes to access student records. In the previous system, college depended mainly on paper records, which had its own set of drawbacks. At the same time while searching any information it is too difficult to access and takes a lot of time to search the particular website. Hence, in order to overcome this problem a smart phone-based application using Android can be used to make this process easy and secure. Keywords: Student Database Management System, Android SDK, User Android Application.
